# Package Managers ([Download latest release](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-pkgman-workflow/releases/latest/download/Package.Managers.alfredworkflow))

Package Repo Search

Quick package/plugin/component (repo) lookup for your favourite package managers. Currently supports *Alcatraz* to *Yeoman Generators*.

## PATH Variable

With macOS ≥12.3 Monterey no longer providing PHP, it's now a prerequisite to install your own.
Simplest way to install it yourself is via `brew install php`.

If you don’t have Homebrew, you can install it via [instructions on their homepage, brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

The `PATH` variable needs to capture not only where PHP is installed, but also where Bash is. Here are two variations:

* Intel Macs: `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
* Apple Silicon Macs: `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`

## Additional Notes

All workflows require constant internet connection.

Workflows can break from time to time due to changes by the provider of the repo. If you notice a workflow stops working, please [file an Issue](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-pkgman-workflow/issues).

All repos have caching enabled to speed up common queries. These caches are refreshed after 14 days and may take longer than expected to return results during update. You can force a cache refresh by running `pkgman cachedb` to re-download the databases (applies to `alcatraz`, `grunt`, `cocoa`). Alternatively you can run `pkgman cleardb` to remove all stored cache, but this isn't recommended. Clearing your cache is recommended after an update if the package manager you use had a bug previously.

The Python Package Index is very slow due to a lack on API and pagination. A min query length has been put in place to help speed this up. You can change it in the script, `$min_query_length = 3`. Perhaps someone with a python background can improve this.

## Contribution

There is a `Makefile` to automate the contribution steps. This `Makefile` have one prerequisite: you should set `ALFRED_PKGMAN_WORKFLOW_DIR` shell environment variable targeting to workflow path installed in Alfred. To get the path you should:

1. Go Alfred Preferences → Workflows
2. Find “Package Managers”
3. Right click on it and select “Open in Finder”

To make a contribution:

1. Make desired changes to workflow / underlying code base
2. Build the Alfred workflow
3. Prepare a new release:
    1. Update `Package Managers.alfredworkflow` file in the root of repository from your newly-built one
    2. Update `info.plist` in the root of the repository

See below for how to run the automation that handles these steps.

### Make changes to workflow / underlying code base

`make linkSourceFoldersToWorkflow` - links src, bin, vendor folders from your local cloned source code folder of the workflow to corresponding folders that installed in Alfred, located at `ALFRED_PKGMAN_WORKFLOW_DIR`.

### Build the Alfred workflow

`make dist` - runs `composer install`, copies sources to `./dist`, copies icons and `info.plist` from `ALFRED_PKGMAN_WORKFLOW_DIR` to `./dist`, zips `./dist` to `./dist/Package Managers.alfredworkflow`

### Prepare a new release

`make release` - builds a new release by copying `info.plist` and `Package Managers.alfredworkflow` from `./dist` to the root of the repository.
